{"title": ["Private Information Retrieval from Non-Replicated Databases"], "authors": ["Karim Banawan", "Sennur Ulukus"], "abstract": ["  We consider the problem of private information retrieval (PIR) of a single\nmessage out of $K$ messages from $N$ non-colluding and non-replicated\ndatabases. Different from the majority of the existing literature, which\nconsiders the case of replicated databases where all databases store the same\ncontent in the form of all $K$ messages, here, we consider the case of\nnon-replicated databases under a special non-replication structure where each\ndatabase stores $M$ out of $K$ messages and each message is stored across $R$\ndifferent databases. This generates an $R$-regular graph structure for the\nstorage system where the vertices of the graph are the messages and the edges\nare the databases. We derive a general upper bound for $M=2$ that depends on\nthe graph structure. We then specialize the problem to storage systems\ndescribed by two special types of graph structures: cyclic graphs and\n\\emph{fully-connected graphs}. We prove that the PIR capacity for the case of\ncyclic graphs is $\\frac{2}{K+1}$, and the PIR capacity for the case of\nfully-connected graphs is $\\min\\{\\frac{2}{K},\\frac{1}{2}\\}$. To that end, we\npropose novel achievable schemes for both graph structures that are\ncapacity-achieving. The central insight in both schemes is to introduce\ndependency in the queries submitted to databases that do not contain the\ndesired message, such that the requests can be compressed. In both cases, the\nresults show severe degradation in PIR capacity due to non-replication.\n"], "primary_subject": ["Information Theory (cs.IT)"], "subjects": ["Information Theory (cs.IT)", "Cryptography and Security (cs.CR)"]}
