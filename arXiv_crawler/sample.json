It has also achieved great success in\nvariation-aware design automation. However, almost all existing techniques\nassume that the parameters are mutually independent or Gaussian correlated,\nwhich is rarely true in real applications. For instance, in chip manufacturing,\nmany process variations are actually correlated. Recently, some techniques have\nbeen developed to handle non-Gaussian correlated random parameters, but they\nare time-consuming for high-dimensional problems. We present a new framework to\nsolve uncertainty quantification problems with many non-Gaussian correlated\nuncertainties. Firstly, we propose a set of smooth basis functions to well\ncapture the impact of non-Gaussian correlated process variations. We develop a\ntensor approach to compute these basis functions in a high-dimension setting.\nSecondly, we investigate the theoretical aspect and practical implementation of\na sparse solver to compute the coefficients of all basis functions. We provide\nsome theoretical analysis for the exact recovery condition and error bound of\nthis sparse solver in the context of uncertainty quantification. We present\nthree adaptive sampling approaches to improve the performance of the sparse\nsolver. Finally, we validate our methods by synthetic and practical\nelectronic/photonic ICs with 19 to 57 non-Gaussian correlated variation\nparameters. Our approach outperforms Monte Carlo by thousands of times in terms\nof efficiency. It can also accurately predict the output density functions with\nmultiple peaks caused by non-Gaussian correlations, which are hard to capture\nby existing methods.\n"], "primary_subject": ["Numerical Analysis (math.NA)"], "subjects": ["Numerical Analysis (math.NA)"]},

In this paper, we utilize Polynomial Chaos Expansion\n(PCE) to show to uncertainty in parameters propagates to uncertainty in the\nreceived signal. In demonstrating its applicability, we consider a Turbulent\nDiffusion Molecular Communication (TDMC) channel and highlight which parameters\naffect the received signals.

However, exactly what kinds of explanation are truly\nhuman-interpretable remains poorly understood. This work advances our\nunderstanding of what makes explanations interpretable under three specific\ntasks that users may perform with machine learning systems: simulation of the\nresponse, verification of a suggested response, and determining whether the\ncorrectness of a suggested response changes under a change to the inputs.\nThrough carefully controlled human-subject experiments, we identify\nregularizers that can be used to optimize for the interpretability of machine\nlearning systems. Our results show that the type of complexity matters:\ncognitive chunks (newly defined concepts) affect performance more than variable\nrepetitions, and these trends are consistent across tasks and domains. This\nsuggests that there may exist some common design principles for explanation\nsystems.\n"], "primary_subject": ["Machine Learning (cs.LG)"], "subjects": ["Machine Learning (cs.LG)", "Machine Learning (stat.ML)"]},
